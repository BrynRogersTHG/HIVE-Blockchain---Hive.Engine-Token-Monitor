# HIVE-Blockchain---Hive.Engine-Token-Monitor
Monitors the BuyBook of any Hive.Engine Token in Realtime

A simple script to monitor the GLX token Buybook. Works in realtime.
Low noise for a large drop, high noise for a large raise in value.
Colour coded.

Change the token variable to monitor tokens other than 'GLX'

token = "GLX"

Time between parsing can be changed with the delay variable.

delay = 5 (default in seconds)

If you want updates faster, delay variable, 5 is 5 seconds.
